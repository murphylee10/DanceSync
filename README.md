# DanceSync
DanceSync is a dance formation tool that will help choreographers with the management of their dance formations for a routine.

Features: 
- Operations: Choreographer accounts supports creating, deleting, and modifying routines, and formations
- SYNCING OF TRANSITIONS & MUSIC: The choreographer sets a STARTING POINT and DURATION for each transition between formations. When they press "view dance", they can view exactly how the dance would look, and the smooth transitions between formations.
- Save and Reload: When the choreographer creates a routine, all of its formations and data are stored to the choreographers account, which they can access at any time.
- Crews: The choreographer can add, delete, and edit CREWS, which represent the individual teams within a dance studio. These crews are used to create routines
- Dancer Login: The individual dancers within a crew can log in to their specific account, and see where they are in all of their formations. (login information: choreographer's username, crew passcode, their full name)

Note: The external libraries required to use this app are found in the "libraries" folder. It may be necessary to configure the build path within your IDE
